## ‚ú® Features
- **Relentless Creepers:** Creepers are faster, have more health, and will ignite automatically when you get too close. They also spawn in timed waves to keep the pressure on.  
- **Three Difficulty Levels:** Choose your challenge with simple in-game commands, from buffed creepers to devastating End Crystal-style explosions.  
- **Deadly Zombies:** When enabled, zombies are permanently transformed into their faster baby variants, dealing extra damage and receiving a permanent Speed II effect.  
- **Timed Block Rewards:** Get a random block every 50 seconds just for surviving. The quality of your loot improves as you complete advancements.  
- **Crouching Crop Growth:** Accelerate your crop growth by crouching near them. Just be aware of the 30% chance for a humorous, particle-filled *event* after a minute.
